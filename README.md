Random Password Generator

When the user clicks the Generate Password button, this will prompt for the length of desired password, and then for the types of characters to include: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. 
The program then randomly generates a password and displays it in the box. 
If the user clicks Copy to clipboard the password is copied to their clipboard.
