// Generate random password

// Generate random number. This method is reported to be random in the cryptographic sense, that is more random than math.random
//  Uint8Array is an array of 8 bits per element. It holds numbers from 0 to 255
var randomArray = new Uint8Array(128);
window.crypto.getRandomValues(randomArray);

console.log("Your lucky numbers:");

}

// Create 4 arrays with possible chars (letters, letters + numbers, letters + special chars, letters + numbers + special chars)
// User input decides from which array the password chars are chosen
// generate a random array of the same size as the password content array
// take the number in the element at each position of the randomArray, and map that to a position in the content array, output that content
// Output each char onto screen as they're produced, to concatenate them into a string and then print that


// output random password
