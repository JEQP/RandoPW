// Generate random password

// Generate random number. This method is reported to be random in the cryptographic sense, that is more random than math.random
//  Uint8Array is an array of 8 bits per element. It holds numbers from 0 to 255
var randomArray = new Uint8Array(128);
window.crypto.getRandomValues(randomArray);

for (var i = 0; i < randomArray.length; i++) {
  console.log(randomArray[i]);
  
}

// Revised criteria: The user can choose to include any and all of four different character types: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, special characters. 
// That would require 24 different arrays using the previous method, which is untenable. 
// Hard-code 4 arrays with each different type of character. Creat currentCharChoice, a zero-length array. As the user chooses characters, concatenate currentCharChoice with the appropriate arrays.
// generate a random array of the required size of the password
// take the number in the element at each position of the randomArray, and map that to a position in the content array, output that content
// NOTE: The number in randomArray may be larger than the size of the contentArray. Figure out a fix.
// Output each char onto screen as they're produced, to concatenate them into a string and then print that


// output random password
